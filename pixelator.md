## Description
The idea is to install cameras for every lane which will capture the number plate of the vehicle and identify the registered user and book the toll on their name.
<li>This toll will then be reflected on our website where the login credentials will be your phone number and a password. <li>On this portal the weekly toll for all the registered vehicles of the user will be displayed along with the number plate of the car. <li>For every car, the date, location, amount per location and total dues will be displayed along with a payment portal.<br> Once paid, the dues will automatically disappear.

### Deep Learning Model
We have trained a YOLO algorithm that is widely in use for license-plate scanning owing to it's high accuracy rate. For character recognition we trained our CNN(convolutional neural network) using Tensorflow, matplot, OpenCv and EasyOCR libraries These are the protocols for reading a license plate that our algorithm follows-<li>RGB to Grey Image Convertor
<li>Grey to Binary Conversion
<li>Median Filtering
<li>Edge Detection
<li>Morphological Operations
<li>Number Plate Extraction
<li>Character Extraction
<li>Character Recognition

## üîÆFuture Scope

List down all the future plans for the project here

- We plan on implementing a security system that will use our algorithm. Basically we can enter the license plate number of the vehicle we want to locate and find it by recording the pincode of the area of the camera which detected that number. This will be useful for policeman to track down vehicles with suspicious intent or missing vehicles. 
- Implement a Pre-paid wallet along with a post-paid portal for flexible usage.

 ## üí∏Applications

> <li> As we know that FastTag ongestion at toll booths causes a frequent traffic jams on highways; the purpose of this project is to completely eradicate the systems of toll booths as a whole which will further reduce traffic congestion as vehicles won‚Äôt have to slow down for toll payment at all and pay their monthly toll at once through a quick and easy interface.
> <li> Crimes committed with the aid of vehicles have also increased. The security feature we wish to add in the future would help the tracking of suspicious or missing vehicles.

Yes, we do believe that this project could be monetized by selling it to the government after increasing the accuracy of our YOLO model further and make it work for faster frame rates. The security feature would also help the police-body in solving road crimes faster.
